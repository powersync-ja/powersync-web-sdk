# PowerSync + Supabase NextJS Demo: Todo List 

## Note: Beta Release

This package is currently in a beta release.

## Overview

Demo app demonstrating use of the [PowerSync SDK for Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journeyapps/powersync-sdk-web) together with Supabase.

A step-by-step guide on Supabase<>PowerSync integration is available [here](https://docs.powersync.co/integration-guides/supabase).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


In your terminal, switch into the demo's directory:

```bash
cd demos/powersync-nextjs-demo
```

Set up the Environment variables: Copy the `.env.local.template` file:

```bash
cp .env.local.template .env.local
```

And then edit `.env.local` to insert your credentials for Supabase.

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm watch
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)
